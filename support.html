This means handling a team of videomakers scripting and editing the weekly updates for our Youtube channel, in coordination with the people at Kamp filming and working in the projects.

It’s very different to any other video production environment, we have many stories to tell happening at once, from landscaping to construction or research, and we established and polished a nice workflow to capture and tell them. It can get intense at moments, so you need to be committed. But its also rewarding, contributing to the bigger mission of serving nature and people. And we have a cool audience who often tell us how much they love the project So if you are looking for a professional challenge, in a very special setting like Project Kamp, working with a growing Youtube channel (more than 750K subscribers and millions views yearly)... give it a try!<br><br><strong>Requirements: </strong>Previous experience in management and teamwork skills. <br>Full-stack video making: scripting, recording, editing and managing a Youtube channel. We would also prefer someone familiar with the project and our weekly videos.<br><strong>When: </strong>At least from March until November 2026. Coming for a couple of months in 2025 is highly recommended.<br><br>
